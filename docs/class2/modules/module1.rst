Configuring Splunk to use the F5 Splunk app 
--------------------------------------------

In order to get Splunk to process and display Analytics data from your
BIG-IPs, you need to configure it to accept this data, parse and process
it, and display it in a meaningful way for you to get the most out of
it. In order to help with this, F5 has collaborated with Splunk to
create a Splunk app that is available as a free add-on to your Splunk
deployment. This F5 Analytics Splunk app can be downloaded from the
Splunkbase web-site here:

`https://apps.splunk.com/apps/id/f5 <https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3161/>`__

.. NOTE:: 
        For your convenience, we have already downloaded this Splunk app onto
        the Windows jump box, so we can just go ahead and install it within our
        Splunk instance.
