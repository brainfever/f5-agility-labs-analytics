Viewing the Analytics Data in Splunk
------------------------------------

Task 3: Visualize the analytics data in Splunk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: 
    It typically takes up to 10 minutes for the system to start showing data in Splunk 
    after you have configured the BIG-IP to send data to it. Please ensure you have waited
    at least 10 minutes after completing the previous task before you start viewing 
    the data in Splunk.


#. In your Chrome browser window, open a new tab, and click on the **Splunk** 
   bookmark to launch the Splunk Web UI

#. In Splunk, click on the F5 Networks app on the left to launch the F5 Splunk 
   app

   |image38|

#. On the Home tab of the F5 Splunk app, change the Time pull-down to 
   **Last 60 minutes**

   |image39|

#. Note that some of the widgets like **Non-Responding Hosts** or
   **Expiring SSL Certificates** may show **No results found**. This is
   because there is nothing to report for these metrics in this lab
   environment.

#. Scroll down to view other widgets. You may find that your BIG-IP
   devices are shown under the **Unhealthy Devices** and/or some
   applications are shown in the **Unhealthy Applications.** Letâ€™s
   investigate:

   |image40|

#. Click on the **F5\_SJC\_Cluster** device group under **Unhealthy
   Devices.** This will open a new browser tab and take you to the
   **Device Cluster Drilldown** dashboard. Here you can see a number of
   different metrics that contribute to the overall device health score.

   |image41|

#. Just under the **Overview** table showing the scores on different
   metrics, you can also see a table showing the **Device Status**, with
   details on the devices included in the group

   |image42|

#. If your devices had any error conditions that generated some
   Diagnostic information, you could see that in the **Diagnostics**
   section.

#. Now click on the **System Performance** tab. This will show you
   details on the CPU and Memory usage of your BIG-IP devices, including
   a breakdown of processes consuming the most amount of CPU or memory

   |image43|

#. Next, click on **Interface Status & Statistics**. This will show you
   detailed Interface and VLAN stats. You can change the options in the
   pull-down menus to view different information.

   |image44|

#. Next, click on the **Events** tab. This tab shows you Syslog events,
   with a time-chart of when different kinds of events occurred. If you
   see any colored squares in the bigip.syslog.pool.statechange syslog
   table, click on those squares. If you then scroll down, you will see
   the actual syslog messages from whatever was happening at that time

   |image45|

#. Feel free to explore the other tabs as well to view additional information

#. Now, let us look at our applications to view more details about them.
   In the red menu bar at the top, click on **Application > Application
   Dashboard.**

   |image46|

#. This will show you a listing of all the applications across all your
   BIG-IPs, based on the application grouping and mappings that you
   defined in the f5.analytics iApp on the BIG-IP. In our case, we just
   have a single application. Click on the **F5\_Demo\_App** application
   name to go into the **Application Drilldown** dashboard

   |image47|

#. The Application Drilldown dashboard shows you a lot of detailed
   statistics about your application(s). You can view the various
   metrics for your application(s) on the **Overview** tab. To get more
   details, you can click the link for the View in Application Health
   Dashboard, which will give you even more detailed metrics and charts
   that are used in calculating the health scores for the various
   metrics:

   |image48|

#. In the **Application Health** Dashboard that opens up in a new
   browser tab, you can view the various metrics as well as charts for
   those metrics that make up the overall Application Health score

#. Now go back to the browser tab for the **Application Drilldown**
   dashboard, and then click on the **Application Resources** tab. This
   tab shows you various components that make up your applications,
   including the facility, virtual servers, pools, pool members, and
   even iRules. In our case, our **F5\_Demo** application is hosted in a
   single Facility (**F5 Lab**), and is made up of 2 Virtual Servers:
   **F5\_Demo\_HTTP\_VS** and **F5\_Demo\_HTTPS\_VS**. Each virtual
   server has its own pool with their corresponding pool members. You
   can view details for all these components in the tables below.

#. Next, click on the **Traffic Overview, Latency, & Analytics** tab.
   This tab shows you detailed traffic-related stats, similar to the
   data available via the AVR charts and reports you saw in Lab 1.

#. Next, click on the **Client Visibility** tab. This tab provides a lot
   of visibility into the traffic between the end-clients and the
   BIG-IP, including connection stats, throughput information, TCP
   stats, HTTP information (HTTP requests, HTTP version, HTTP
   compression info, etc.), SSL information (SSL throughput, SSL
   protocol info, ciphers, SSL renegotiations, etc.). Similarly, the
   **Server Visibility** tab provides similar information for the
   traffic between the BIG-IPs and the back-end application servers.

#. The **Pool Statistics** tab provides details on the various pools and
   pool members across all the BIG-IPs and each application / virtual
   server on each BIG-IP.

#. Feel free to explore other tabs including the **System Performance**
   and the **Alerts and Logs** tabs.


.. NOTE::
    This concludes all the lab steps for the Splunk Integration lab.  Feel 
    free to explore other portions of the F5 Splunk app, or try out other 
    settings in the f5.analytics iApp. Note that this lab environment does not 
    include other F5 modules (DNS/GTM, ASM, or APM). However, if you have these 
    other modules enabled on your BIG-IP devices in your own environment, you 
    can view data for these modules as well in the F5 Splunk app.
