Task 1 â€“ Provision the AVR module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Determine which BIG-IP is the standby unit by looking at the status
   in the top-left corner of each of the BIG-IP GUI windows. Normally
   BIGIP2 should be the standby, but in some cases, you may find that
   BIGIP1 is the standby unit.

#. First, on the standby unit, go to **System >> Resource Provisioning**

#. For the **Application Visibility and Reporting (AVR)** module,
   check-mark the box under the **Provisioning** column, and ensure the
   Provisioning level is set to **Nominal**.

#. Click **Submit**

   .. NOTE::
     This procedure will cause services to be restarted on the
     BIG-IP and may cause interruption to the traffic that is passing through
     the unit. Hence, it is always recommended to perform this step during a
     maintenance window, and to start with the Standby unit first. 
    
#. Once the services have been restarted, click **Continue**.

#. Repeat the above steps for the other (Active) BIG-IP unit. Note that
   when you do so, the Active unit will go into Standby state, and the
   other unit will take over as Active.
