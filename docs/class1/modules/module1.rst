Configuring AVR to generate on-box Analytics reports
----------------------------------------------------

In this lab, you will first configure an Analytics profile to attach to
your existing applications (Virtual Servers). You will then view the
analytics graphs and charts on the BIG-IP to gain more insight into the
traffic patterns for incoming traffic for your applications.

.. NOTE::
    You will perform all configuration tasks from the Windows jump box
 

#. On the Windows Jump box, open the Chrome browser, and then use the 
   bookmarks in the bookmark bar to access **BIGIP\_1** and **BIGIP\_2** in 
   separate tabs. If you get a warning about an invalid SSL certificate, 
   ignore the warning, and continue to the login page.

#. Login to both BIG-IPs with these credentials:

   - username: ``admin``

   - password: ``Agility2018``
